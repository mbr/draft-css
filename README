Draft CSS
=========
If you write small, web-based applications often, you do not want to spend a lot of time adding any eye candy. However, you could do with a set of prettier defaults.

These stylesheets are intended to be simple, almost non-intrusive and quickly linked into any HTML/XHTML document, so you can have reasonably pretty output from the first time on you render a page.

Usage
-----
These files are intended to be linked directly from github into the respective documents:

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://github.com/mbr/draft-css/raw/master/simple-ssbw.css">

Of course, you can always download and include them as well.
