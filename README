Draft CSS
=========
If you write small, web-based applications often, you do not want to spend a lot of time adding any eye candy. However, you could do with a set of prettier defaults.

These stylesheets are intended to be simple, almost non-intrusive and quickly linked into any HTML/XHTML document, so you can have reasonably pretty output from the first time on you render a page.
